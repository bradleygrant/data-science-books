My data science reading list


## Python Books

**Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython** -- Wes McKinney, ISBN 978-1491957660
> The leading book on Pandas, written by the developer of Pandas.

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** -- Aurélien Géron, ISBN 978-1492032649
> This book assumes that you know close to nothing about Machine Learning. Its goal is to give you the concepts, tools, and intuition you need to implement programs capable of learning from data. We will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly used (such as linear regression) to some of the Deep Learning techniques that regularly win competitions.
